> **Make a scatterplot, barchart and boxplot and draw inferences from dataset downloaded from www.data.gov.in**

### Dataset and files
> The dataset is <a href="#my_anchor">[1]</a> **Rainfall in South Peninsula And its Departure for Monsoon Session (June-Septemebr) from 1901-2016** and is  downloaded from www.data.gov.in.
>> The link to download the dataset is https://data.gov.in/resource/rainfall-south-peninsula-10-subdivisions-and-its-departure-normal-monsoon-session-june-0 .<br/> The data consists of consumer price index for various elements such items such as Cereals, Meat and Fish, Fruits, Healthcare products and many other products.
> All the files are contained in the zip folder **module4**
1.  **south_pen-India_rainfall_act_dep_1901_2016.csv** is the csv file of the data set. The name is kept same as the name we see on downloading. 
2.  **rainfall_peninsula_2016.py** in the github repository is the python script for the python code for plotting. 
3.  **rainfall_peninsula_2016.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook.

### Scatter Plots
> Here are a few scatter plots

1.This plot shows the variation of the rainfall across many years for the months June, July, September
2.Inference here is that as the in general the rainfall in July is higher than that of June and September. While comparing rainfall between June and September it is not so clear which month has higher rainfall from this graph but September has lower dips compared to the June. 
3.Across various years there is no clear trend and the rainfall seems to be constant although the peak rainfall years are before 2000.

1.  The plot shows the variation of consumer price index for cereals and products for different sectors Rural, Urban and Rural+Urban 
2.  We notice that the spraed is almost same for all except for Urban which show higher spread. 
3.  The median consumer price index is higher in Rural as compared to Urban and Rural+Urban 
4.  The Maximum and minimum values of consimer price index is higher than that for rural and rural+urban.

### Line Graph

1.  The line graph shows the variation of the consumer price index for the month of July from 2013 to 2021 for three different sectors Rural, Urban and Rural+Urban. 
2.  We can see that the consumer index is highest for Rural , followed by Rural + Urban and then followed by Urban .
3.  Primarily this which could indicate that inflation is higher in the rural areas. This could be a combination of many reasons, it may also be related to export and import regulatory rules.
